# JSON Processing of RICO Dataset

These scripts are used to process JSON layouts of [RICO dataset](http://interactionmining.org/rico).
The result of processed layouts has been used in [a paper in CHI '20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376327).

## Scripts

### `draw_image.py`

It draws bounding boxes of layout components.<br />
You may find the mapping between colors and component categories in the `settings.py` file.
